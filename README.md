# Quiz Website - Project

This website was created for the second milestone project as part of the Code Institute course.

## Concept

The user will be brought to a homepage which will give the user the option to start the game. On click, the quiz will begin and the webpage will change. The user will select an answer from 4 possible answers. The style of the button will change colour to indicate a correct or incorrect answer. A status bar will load at the top of the webpage to indicate the number of questions completed. A scoreboard will also be displayed at the top of the page.


## Testing

*This is placeholder text until the site is complete*. Testing during coding took place by refreshing the browser preview in Chrome and playing through the quiz, including using the restart button to check that the quiz reloaded properly, after each significant new section of code was written.

### Manual Testing
External links have all been tested, to check that each link opens correctly and opens in a new browser.
Both correct and incorrect answers to all questions have been selected, to check that both function as intended.

### Device and Cross-Browser Testing
The quiz has been tested by playing it through on a range of browsers and devices, including:
Chrome, Firefox and Edge on a laptop (ASUS Vivobook Pro 14)
Chrome and Safari on iPhones (iPhone 13 Pro and iPhone XS)

### Validator Testing

W3C HTML validator
Jigsaw CSS validator
JS Hint JavaScript validator
