# Quiz Website - Project

This website was created for the second milestone project as part of the Code Institute course.

## Concept

The user will be brought to a homepage which will give the user the option to start the game. On click, the quiz will begin and the webpage will change. The user will select an answer from 4 possible answers. The style of the button will change colour to indicate a correct or incorrect answer. A status bar will load at the top of the webpage to indicate the number of questions completed. A scoreboard will also be displayed at the top of the page.
