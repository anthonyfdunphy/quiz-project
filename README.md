This website was created for the second milestone project as part of the Code Institute course.

## Concept

The user will be brought to a homepage which will give the user the option to start the game. On click, the quiz will begin and the webpage will change. The user will select an answer from 4 possible answers. The style of the button will change colour to indicate a correct or incorrect answer. A status bar will load at the top of the webpage to indicate the number of questions completed. A scoreboard will also be displayed at the top of the page. The user will lose a point for every wrong answer selected.

When the quiz is completed, the user is given the option to restart the game, click on the button which brings the user to the high scores page or save there score to the high scores page.

## Technologies utilised in this project

- **HTML**: Website structure was developed using the HTML language
- **CSS**: Styling of the page was with CSS using an external stylesheet - linked to from the main HTML page
- **Javascript**: Website structure was developed using the HTML language
- **Github**: Source code of the website is hosted on the my Github repo - push and commited sent to from Gitpod when developing the site

# UX/UI Design

The sites design was wireframed with drawing shown below. The design would consist of a landing/homepage, the user would be greeted with a start button. Once this button was clicked, the user would have a question revealed with a series of possible answers available to them.

My design consisted of 3 seperate linear gradient background - the main background, the correct answer background and the wrong answer background.

## Deployment

The steps I followed for deploying to Github were as follow:

1. Navigate to github.com in my browser
2. Log into my account using my user credentials
3. Create a new repository
4. User Gitpod edit the files
5. Created a HTML file, a CSS file and a Javascript - some of which sat within an assets folder which helped for organising the file structure

## Testing

*This is placeholder text until the site is complete*. Testing during coding took place by refreshing the browser preview in Chrome and playing through the quiz, including using the restart button to check that the quiz reloaded properly, after each significant new section of code was written.

### Manual Testing
External links have all been tested, to check that each link opens correctly and opens in a new browser.
Both correct and incorrect answers to all questions have been selected, to check that both function as intended.

### Device and Cross-Browser Testing
The quiz has been tested by playing it through on a range of browsers and devices, including:
Chrome, Firefox and Edge on a laptop
Chrome and Safari for iPhone

### Validator Testing

#### Lighthouse

I used Google's open-source, automated tool for improving the performance, quality, and correctness of your web apps. I got the following results from my website review using this tool
